## :wave: Welcome to  Pimple Tracker

Designed for people who suffer from **frequent acne**, my platform allows you to track the **level** and **risk** of acne not only on your **face** but also on your **entire body**.

### Key Features:
- **Monitor** the **state**, **appearance**, and **disappearance time** of each acne lesion :pencil2:.
- Record the number of times you've **popped a pimple** (though we advise that this is not a **hygienic** or **safe** practice).

### My Goal
My aim is to help you take control of your acne and make **informed decisions** about your **skin health**. :hospital: By using my website, you'll gain a better understanding of your skin and discover **effective ways** to combat acne.

## How to Start Using It
Run the following command to get started:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Congratulations! You can access the API documentation at: `localhost:8000/docs`.

## Thank You!
Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you again! :grin:
